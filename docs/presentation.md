PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Stallion Novels is a public and online platform for reading, writing and sharing webnovels. 


Flow:
Visitors open the website and are sent to the welcome page where they are presented with the platform. 
The goal of the welcome page is to introduce them with the core functionalities of the platform. 
The page will present them with simple call-to-actions, mainly to redirect them to the registration or login page.
